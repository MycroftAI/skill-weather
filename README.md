Weather conditions and forecasts

## About 
Get weather conditions, forecasts, expected precipitation and more!  By default it will tell
you about your default location, or you can ask for other cities around the world. 

Current conditions and weather forecasts come from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org).

For **enclosures** with screen support, conditions are briefly shown using visemes.

The temperature is shown in Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on the preferences set in your [https://home.mycroft.ai](https://home.mycroft.ai) account. 

## Examples
